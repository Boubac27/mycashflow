The gross yield is the simplest to determine, and for good reason: it does not take into account the rental charges paid by the lessor or its taxation. Therefore, it is sufficient to report the annual rent at the acquisition price to identify the gross profitability of the real estate investment.</p>
                            <p>
<strong>Example of calculating the gross yield:</strong> an investor leases an apartment at a monthly rent of 800 euros including charges. He paid his real estate purchase 200,000 euros, including acquisition costs. The gross profitability of the property is therefore:

(800x12 / 200,000) x 100 = 4.80%.</p>

              <br>
              <p>
To go further, investors must be interested in the profitability of their rental taking into account the costs and charges they must bear as such, such as property tax.</p>

To calculate the return on your investment as closely as possible, the lessor must also take into consideration his taxes. This is the principle of "net-net" return or net of taxation: it takes into account the tax burden borne by the investor, that is to say the taxation of property income.</p>
